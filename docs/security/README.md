# EXITLINK OMEGA Security Documentation

This document provides detailed information about the security features and practices implemented in EXITLINK OMEGA.

## Encryption Architecture

EXITLINK OMEGA uses a multi-layered encryption approach to ensure the security of user data:

### Client-Side Encryption

1. **Content Encryption**
   - Algorithm: AES-256-GCM
   - Implementation: Web Crypto API
   - Key Derivation: PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
   - Salt: Randomly generated 16-byte salt

2. **Key Management**
   - Content encryption keys are derived from a combination of:
     - Link-specific random key
     - Optional user-provided password
   - Keys are never transmitted to the server in their original form

3. **Post-Quantum Protection (Optional)**
   - Algorithm: Kyber-768
   - Implementation: libsodium-pq
   - Provides protection against quantum computing attacks

### Server-Side Encryption

1. **Storage Encryption**
   - All data stored in MinIO is encrypted using:
     - Server-side AES-256 encryption
     - Unique key per file
   - Database fields containing sensitive information are encrypted

2. **Key Wrapping**
   - Content keys are wrapped using HKDF with:
     - Server master key
     - User-specific salt
     - Link-specific nonce

3. **Key Rotation**
   - Server master keys are rotated periodically
   - Old keys are securely archived for data recovery

## Authentication and Authorization

### Wallet-Based Authentication

1. **HD Wallet Generation**
   - 12-word mnemonic phrase (BIP-39 standard)
   - Derivation path: m/44'/60'/0'/0/0
   - Entropy: 128 bits (12 words)

2. **JWT Authentication**
   - Algorithm: RS256
   - Expiration: 24 hours
   - Refresh mechanism: Sliding session

3. **Authorization**
   - Role-based access control
   - Resource ownership verification
   - Rate limiting

## Link Security Features

### Self-Destruction Triggers

1. **View Count**
   - Links can be configured to self-destruct after a specific number of views
   - Default: 1 view (view once)

2. **Time Expiration**
   - Links can be configured to expire after a specific time period
   - Default: 24 hours
   - Maximum: 30 days

3. **Region Lock**
   - Links can be restricted to specific geographic regions
   - Implementation: GeoIP database lookup
   - Accuracy: Country level

4. **Device Lock**
   - Links can be restricted to specific devices
   - Implementation: Browser fingerprinting
   - Factors: User agent, screen resolution, installed fonts, etc.

5. **Screenshot Detection**
   - Links can be configured to self-destruct if a screenshot is attempted
   - Implementation: JavaScript event listeners
   - Detection methods:
     - Print event detection
     - Screen capture API detection
     - CSS-based screenshot detection

### Link Camouflage

Links can be disguised to appear as:
- Google Docs
- Dropbox files
- PDF documents
- Error pages
- Custom templates

## Network Security

### TLS Configuration

- Minimum TLS version: 1.2
- Preferred cipher suites:
  - TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
  - TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
  - TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
- HSTS enabled with preload
- Certificate: Let's Encrypt with automatic renewal

### API Protection

- CORS configuration with strict origin policy
- Rate limiting:
  - 100 requests per minute for authenticated users
  - 10 requests per minute for unauthenticated users
- Request size limiting
- Input validation and sanitization

### Web Application Firewall

- ModSecurity with OWASP Core Rule Set
- Custom rules for EXITLINK-specific threats
- IP reputation checking
- Brute force protection

## Infrastructure Security

### Docker Security

- Minimal base images
- Non-root users
- Read-only file systems
- No privileged containers
- Resource limits
- Regular security updates

### Database Security

- PostgreSQL:
  - Network access restricted to application servers
  - TLS encryption for connections
  - Strong password policy
  - Regular backups with encryption

- Redis:
  - Password authentication
  - No external access
  - Encrypted persistence
  - Data expiration policies

### Storage Security

- MinIO:
  - Server-side encryption
  - Object lifecycle policies
  - Versioning disabled
  - No public access

## Privacy Features

### Zero Knowledge Design

- No personal data collection
- No email or phone number required
- No IP address logging (except for abuse prevention)
- No tracking cookies

### Data Minimization

- Content is stored only for the minimum time necessary
- Automatic purging of expired content
- No backup retention of expired content

### Metadata Protection

- Minimal metadata storage
- Encrypted link metadata
- No correlation between wallet and content

## Secure Development Practices

### Code Security

- Static code analysis
- Dependency scanning
- Regular security audits
- Peer code review

### Vulnerability Management

- Responsible disclosure program
- Regular penetration testing
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Prompt security patching

### Secure Deployment

- Immutable infrastructure
- Continuous security monitoring
- Automated security testing in CI/CD
- Secure secret management

## Compliance Considerations

### GDPR Compliance

- Data minimization
- Right to be forgotten (automatic)
- No personal data processing
- No cross-border data transfers

### Export Control

- Encryption categorized under ECCN 5D002
- Open source exception applies
- TSU exception for publicly available encryption

## Security Recommendations for Users

### Wallet Security

- Store recovery phrase securely
- Do not share recovery phrase
- Use a password manager for recovery phrase storage

### Link Sharing

- Use secure channels to share links
- Set appropriate expiration times
- Use password protection for sensitive content

### Self-Hosting Security

- Keep server software updated
- Use a dedicated server for EXITLINK
- Enable server firewall
- Monitor server logs
