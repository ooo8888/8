### JavaScript Styleguide

All JavaScript code is linted with ESLint and formatted with Prettier.

- Prefer the object spread operator (`{...anotherObj}`) to `Object.assign()`
- Inline `export`s with expressions whenever possible
  ```js
  // Use this:
  export const foo = 'bar';

  // Instead of:
  const foo = 'bar';
  export { foo };
  ```
- Place requires in the following order:
  - Built-in Node Modules (such as `path`)
  - Local Modules (using relative paths)
- Place class properties in the following order:
  - Class methods and properties (methods starting with `static`)
  - Instance methods and properties

### CSS Styleguide

- Use TailwindCSS utility classes whenever possible
- For custom CSS, use CSS modules
- Use kebab-case for class names

### Documentation Styleguide

- Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) for documentation.
- Reference methods and classes in markdown with the custom `{}` notation:
    - Reference classes with `{ClassName}`
    - Reference instance methods with `{ClassName#methodName}`
    - Reference class methods with `{ClassName.methodName}`
